## Description
<p>
The propouse of the project is to manage and controll a group of nurses from a hospital. We manage their information and save it to follow up about their updates. In this project we apply a CRUD for the doctors where you can **create**, **read**, **update** and **delete** them. Also, we work with a cloud database where we save all the information.
